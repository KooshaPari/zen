Status: Operational validation plan.

Goal: Ensure the MCP server's end-to-end flow works by exercising a representative simulator test and verifying logs/output.

Steps:
1) Verify repo setup and environment variables
2) Run a focused simulator test (basic_conversation)
3) Inspect stdout and server logs for successful tool execution and continuation
4) If failures occur, capture error details and propose fixes

Notes:
- Running simulator tests may invoke external model APIs (OpenRouter/Gemini/etc.).
- This requires network access; approve when prompted.
