OAuth Flow Fix - Patch for server_mcp_http.py

The issue: After successful WebAuthn verification, the OAuth flow doesn't complete
because there's no session cookie set, causing an infinite redirect loop.

Solution: Modify the flow to properly handle the authorization code generation
after consent approval.
